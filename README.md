# Official Roadmap Declaration for *BitShares Blockchain*

As formal *BitShares Blockchain* core token shareholders we are responsible to one another for maintaining integrity among our culture and core values around *BitShares Blockchain* hence we had formed a group of *BitShares Blockchain* developers and believers; a great team of visionaries and developers developing the project using official GitHub page [BitShares](https://github.com/bitshares) while addressing project's features and functions over main official website [BitShares.GitHub.io](https://bitshares.github.io) and addressing the vision and mission of the *BitShares Group* at group website [BitShares Group](https://BitSharesGroup.org) in order to develop and maintain this great project and it's continuous products and innovations.

*BitShares Group* was formed as an independent organization acting in the best interests of *BitShares Blockchain*. We address *BitShares Blockchain* as a decentralized “Blockchain As Organization” (BAO); a financial innovation in which users incorporate with Blockchain in order to produce a secure and reliable decentralized financial enterprise and FinTech ecosystem.

## *BitShares Group* Vision and Mission

*BitShares Blockchain* is described by *BitShares Group* as an industrial-grade decentralized Web 3.0 platform built for high-performance financial means and smart contracts operations, *BitShares Blockchain* enables its core token shareholders to decide its future financial products and decide how existing products work, *BitShares Blockchain* had successfully implemented several financial technology products such as (Utility Token, Cryptocurrencies, Stocks, Treasury Operations, Collaterals Risk Management Operations, Margin Trading Platform and Commodities Management System). Unlike traditional financial platforms, users of *BitShares Blockchain* have complete control over their values and financial means over *BitShares Blockchain*, which cannot be changed, frozen or seized by any third-party. In addition to allowing *BitShares Blockchain* users to trade their own financial means, *BitShares Blockchain* offers a wide range of built-in features and functions including User Issued Asset (UIA), Market Pegged Asset (MPA), Decentralized Exchange Engine (DEX), Decentralized Finance (DeFi), financial derivatives, loans, liquidity pools, Automated Market Maker (AMM), prediction market, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), Hashed Time-lock Contract (HTLC) voting, and much more.

*BitShares Group* vision is to integrate corporate investors, companies, share holders, business assets and other financial means into a unified Open Source Blockchain ecosystem which makes financial features and functions more efficient, transparent and reliable to it’s users, Corporate shares are heavily regulated by the SEC, but none of those regulations prevent them from being issued or traded on an alternative trading system. The regulations in many jurisdictions require all shares to be registered (aka held by known identities). *BitShares Blockchain* corporate shares can be used as collateral for a bond or be used in any number of smart contracts.

*BitShares Group* is acting as an educational resource which designed to help users to understand *BitShares Blockchain* and below key concepts:

## *BitShares Group* culture and core principles

Trust: We believe trust is foundational to our mission and building trust is a slow, steady process. Trust is hard-earned and easily lost.

Relationships: We believe in close working relationships with developers and organizations that build on and contribute to the *BitShares Blockchain*.

Resources: We value maintaining and allocating scarce resources and support to compete on an equal playing field with other foundations in achieving our goals.

*BitShares Group* is at the heart of this: we need to not just serve the *BitShares Blockchain* community, but work with them and incorporate their feedback. 

*BitShares Group* isn't just the only community behind the development of BitShares as we must remember our community is global, containing people from many languages, regions, and cultures.

*BitShares Blockchain* is always evolving, so [BitShares Group](https://BitSharesGroup.org) will too. That's why the site has a simple design system & modular structure. We make iterative changes as we learn more about how people use the group site and what the community wants from it.

## *BitShares Group* contributions and resources:

1) Main website BitShares.github.io hosted at GitHub:

We're open source, with a community of contributors, so you can propose changes or help us out too over GitHub Repo:

https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares.github.io

*BitShares Blockchain* is a huge work: it includes a community, a technology, a set of ideas and ideologies, and more. This means *BitShares Group* needs to handle many different user journeys, from “a developer who wants a specific tool” and “a newcomer who just bought some BTS and doesn’t know what a wallet is".

2) Reference wallet platform [BTS Exchange](https://BTS.Exchange) automatically deployed from GitHub: 

https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui

We have a style guide to standardize certain aspects of writing content to make the contribution process smoother.

https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui-style-guide

3) We welcome feedback on both the reference wallet and the style guide. Remember, *BitShares Group* is for the community, by the community.

Ever since the launch of [BitShares Group](https://BitSharesGroup.org), we strive to be transparent about how we operate. This is one of our core values because we believe transparency is crucial to *BitShares Blockchain* success.
